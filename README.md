# Getting Started with Gmail Cleaner App

This application is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [React.js](https://react.dev/), and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/). It connects to the Gmail API to help you manage your inbox by reading emails, grouping them by either email address or domain name, and displaying the count of emails found. You can then delete emails by email ID or domain name.

## üßê Features
 - **Connect to Gmail API: Authenticate and access your Gmail account.**

 - **Paginated Email Fetching: Read emails in batches to efficiently handle large inboxes.**

 - **Group Emails: Group emails by individual addresses or domain names.**

 - **Delete Emails: Option to delete by email ID or domain name.**

 - **Material UI Interface: User-friendly interface built with Material UI.**

 1. Node.js (v12.x or higher)

 2. npm (Node package manager)
